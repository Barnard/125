Committed to higher education for women, Meyer petitioned Columbia University to create an affiliated institution exclusively for young women. She succeeded and subsequently served as a trustee of this newly created college from 1889 to 1951. After 62 years as a trustee, Meyer died in 1951. She married Alfred Meyer, a doctor, in 1887, and her sister was suffragist Maud Nathan. She worked as a writer and had a daughter, Margaret Meyer, who died in 1923. She was a member of the MacDowell Club and the Lyceum Club of London, and an honorary member of the National League of American Pen Women.
