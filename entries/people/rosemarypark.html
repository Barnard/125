p1: Rosemary Park became president of Barnard after Millicent McIntosh retired in 1962. Her father, Dr. J. Edward Park, was president of Wheaton College, and at the time that she became president of Barnard, her brother was president of Simmons College in Boston. She graduated summa cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1928 with a degree in German and received her master’s degree in 1929. She studied in Germany at the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne, where she earned her Ph.D. in 1934. She taught German at Wheaton and later at Connecticut College. There, she held a series of positions: dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, and finally president. While at Connecticut College, which was all-women at the time, she established Connecticut College for Men and later admitted men as graduate students. She served as president there from 1947 to 1962, strengthening the curriculum, adding new buildings, and raising large amounts of funds.

Park continued that work at Barnard. She encouraged students to pursue degrees in the sciences and fought for Barnard to have its own new science laboratory, despite discouragement from Columbia, which felt that its existing labs were sufficient. She believed that by continuing not to have its own lab, Barnard would be conveying the message “that it didn’t believe in science for women.” Furthermore, she encouraged women to study subjects such as advanced mathematics and foreign languages in order to fill society’s need for scientists and linguists. After leaving Barnard, she went on to UCLA, where she served as vice chancellor and later as a professor. At UCLA, she helped establish the Plato Society, an academic program for retired persons. As a member of the Society, Park took courses until her death in 2004 at the age of 97.
