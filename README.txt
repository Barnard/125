How to add to the instiutional history:

This site relies heavily on templates, which allows one major advantage. A user can write one entry and without any additonal effort that entry will be accesable from the search, era, and category pages. 

For all of this to work, the entry needs to be added to the correct folder. For example, to write an entry about a person, go to the /entries/people/ folder. 

Download the template found in that folder, and add the information to it as needed. 
After you finish the entries for the day, put all the finished entires in the folder, and the entire site will be updated automatically.
