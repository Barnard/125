Welcome to the source code of Barnard 125, (barnard125.org) an institutional history of Barnard’s first 125 years. A digital version of Professor Robert A. McCaughey’s book, the site is a resource for learning more about the history of Barnard. This guide will explain how to create an entry.
I have done my best to make adding an entry as fast as possible, and to require no coding. If you find an edge case I haven’t accounted for (a 20 paragraph entry, 7 pictures, something like that) just let me know. 

Each entry will be one html file, which you can store in the corresponding folder in the entries folder. For now open up the template under entries. It is called entry template. 

You must enter the category code, the era code, the full title of the entry, and the text for that entry. You must call the html file the full name of the entry, all lowercase, no spaces or dashes. 
Here are the codes: (I made them as short as possible because you’re probably going to need to enter them a lot, but I can change them to whatever you want) 
Sub-Categories (enter this after layout with a space, i.e. layout: a)

Era (enter after era, same as above with a space) 

pr - Pre-Barnard (Before 1889)
ea - Early Barnard (1889 - 1917)
in - Interwar Barnard (1918 - 1939)
po - Postwar Barnard (1940 - 1964)
em - Embattled Barnard (1965 - 1989)
re - Recent Barnard (1990 - Present) 

							


As for title, that’s just the name of what the entry is. So a person’s full name, or the full name of a building. 
For the text, enter each paragraph under the corresponding p. So first paragraph under p1: , the next under p2: , and so on. This can go up to p20: , (and higher if you need) so feel free to add in more if you need. 
The rest are optional, and you can fill them in accordingly.
